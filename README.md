## 📦 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
cd server && npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Servers
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend simultaneously
npm run start:all

# Or start separately:
# Backend (Terminal 1)
npm run server

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
npm run dev
```

### 3. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Animation Strategy
- **Framer Motion**: Chosen for React integration and powerful animation primitives
- **Staggered Animations**: Creates engaging entrance effects for product lists
- **Spring Physics**: Provides natural, responsive feel to interactions
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user accessibility preferences

### State Management
- **Zustand**: Lightweight alternative to Redux with TypeScript support
- **Local State**: Component-level state for UI-specific data
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated data fetching logic with error handling

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image Lazy Loading**: Products load images as they come into view
- **Memoized Calculations**: Expensive filtering and sorting operations cached
- **Backend Caching**: 5-minute cache for frequently requested data
- **Compression**: Gzip compression on backend responses

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-First**: Designed for mobile devices first, enhanced for larger screens
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: 
  - Mobile: 1 column
  - Tablet: 2 columns  
  - Desktop: 3-4 columns
- **Touch-Friendly**: Appropriately sized touch targets

## 🧪 API Endpoints

The backend proxy provides these endpoints:

- `GET /api/products` - Get paginated products
- `GET /api/products/categories` - Get all categories
- `GET /api/products/category/:category` - Get products by category
- `GET /api/products/:id` - Get single product details
- `GET /health` - Health check and cache status
- `POST /api/cache/clear` - Clear cache (development)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel/Netlify)
```bash
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to your preferred hosting service
```

### Backend (Heroku/Railway)
```bash
cd server
# Follow your hosting provider's Node.js deployment guide
```
